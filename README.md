# GhostWire Audio  
*A one-person lab for real-time sound systems*

GhostWire Audio exists to explore the space between sound and software—where creative ideas meet buffers, threads, and hardware.

This repo is the notebook for that exploration.

## What This Is

This is a collection of:
- Architecture diagrams
- Design decisions
- Real-time safety rules
- Roadmaps
- Long-form write-ups about what I’m building and why

If the code shows *how* something works, this repo explains *why it exists at all*.

## What I Care About

- **Real-time systems**  
  Understanding what can and can’t happen inside an audio thread.

- **Transparency**  
  Making complex software readable, not just functional.

- **Systems thinking**  
  Looking at audio tools as full machines, not isolated features.

- **Learning in public**  
  Writing down mistakes, tradeoffs, and discoveries as they happen.

## How This Lab Is Structured

- `gw-core` — The engine
- `gw-testlab` — The instruments
- `spectral-ghost` — The public prototype
- `ghostwire-docs` — The notebook

## Status

This is a living document. Things will change as the systems evolve.

If something here feels incomplete, that usually means I’m still figuring it out.
